    <h1>turkish coffee</h1>
    <img src="caf.jpeg">
    <p>Turks are passionately devoted to their beloved Turkish coffee, and it is deeply rooted in their culture.</p>
    <p>The term "kahvalti" ("breakfast") itself implies that they start the day by drinking a cup of this energizing beverage - </p>
    <p>so much so that another word for the colour brown, “kahverengi” means ‘coffee coloured!’</p>
    <h1>Culture of serving</h1>
    <p>Instead of drinking Turkish coffee as you would an espresso, it's best to indulge in its flavour and aroma by sipping slowly with friends.</p>
    <p>Traditionally served in demitasse cups, this beverage is meant for relishing the moment rather than gulping down the grounds that come along with it!</p>
   <p> In fact, conversing over small doses of Turkish coffee customarily takes up an entire hour; hence making it not just a drink but also a cultural experience.</p>
    <p>Enjoying Turkish coffee isn't typically complete without a complimentary glass of water and perhaps even some delectable Turkish delight. </p>
    <p>This pairing helps to balance the strong and intense flavour of this captivating beverage.</p>
